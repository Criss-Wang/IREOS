# IREOS
This is a simple python implementation of the IREOS (Internal, Relative Evaluation of Outlier Solutions) from the paper *Internal Evaluation of Unsupervised Outlier Detection.*

Original paper:

```latex
H. O. Marques, R. J. G. B. Campello, J. Sander, and A. Zimek.
Internal Evaluation of Unsupervised Outlier Detection. ACM Trans. Knowl. Discov. Data, Vol. 14, No. 4, Article 47, 2020.
```

This work is a direct migration with significant simplification from the work of Henrique O. Marques, the direct author of the paper.

To use the Java version with a more robust and structured implementation, please refer to [ireos-extension repository](https://github.com/homarques/ireos-extension).

My work is also based on the original work from the repository above.
